my project is a mobile application that is made for the outer clinics in the hospital. The application is for two types of users which are patients,  and doctors.  Patients can use this application to reach all outer clinics, display all doctors, and book appointments. They can find the best doctor with the highest rate in the clinic. Also, they can see the others’ reviews about appointments with this doctor. This application gives them the flexibility to cancel the appointment and book again. After the appointment, the patient can see his prescription through his account, and he can add his reviews and rate this appointment. When the patient logs in, the application will ask him questions to list his medical history. On the doctor’s side, he can easily reach his patients and see their information and their medical history. The doctor can make his schedule and select the available time for appointments. Also, in his profile, he can select his bill. In addition, he can display all the past and upcoming appointments with patients. For each past appointment, he can write the prescription. And for the upcoming, he can easily cancel them if he wants. If the doctor or the patient cancels the appointment after booking, an announcement will be sent to the other side and will be shown in his profile.
